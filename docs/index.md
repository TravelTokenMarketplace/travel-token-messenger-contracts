## ITTMAccount

### initialize

```solidity
function initialize(address manager, address bookingToken, address owner, address upgrader) external
```

## TTMAccount

A TTM Account manages funds, minting/buying of booking tokens, provided
or wanted services, and multiple bots for distributors and suppliers on
Travel Token Messenger ecosystem.

Registering bots is done by role based access control. Bot's with
`MESSENGER_BOT_ROLE` are authorized to represent the TTMAccount.
Bot can also have `GAS_WITHDRAWER_ROLE` and `BOOKING_OPERATOR_ROLE`.

`GAS_WITHDRAWER_ROLE` enables a bot to withdraw native coins (ETH) from the
contract to be used as gas money. This restricted with a `limit`
(wei) and `period` (seconds) by the `BOT_ADMIN_ROLE`. Default starting
values are 10 ETH per 24 hours.

`BOOKING_OPERATOR_ROLE` enables a bot to mint and buy Booking Tokens by
calling the corresponding functions on the {BookingToken} contract. The buy
operation pays the price of the Booking Token with the funds on the
{TTMAccount} contract.

_This contract uses UUPS style upgradeability. The authorization function
`_authorizeUpgrade(address)` can be called by the `UPGRADER_ROLE` and is
restricted to only upgrade to the implementation address registered on the
{TTMAccountManager} contract._

### UPGRADER_ROLE

contract.

### GAS_WITHDRAWER_ROLE

```solidity
bytes32 GAS_WITHDRAWER_ROLE
```

Gas withdrawer role can withdraw gas money from the contract. This is
intended to be used by the bots and is granted when `addMessengerBot` is
called.

### WITHDRAWER_ROLE

```solidity
bytes32 WITHDRAWER_ROLE
```

Withdrawer role can withdraw funds from the contract.

### BOOKING_OPERATOR_ROLE

```solidity
bytes32 BOOKING_OPERATOR_ROLE

functions on this contract. This is generally used by the bots. The
price for the booking token is paid by this contract.

## TTMAccountManager

This contract manages the creation of the Travel Token Messenger accounts by
deploying {ERC1967Proxy} proxies that point to the{TTMAccount} implementation
address.

Create TTM Account: Users who want to create an account should call
`createTTMAccount(address admin, address upgrader)` function with addresses of
the accounts admin and upgrader roles and they also need to approve the service
fee token with the amount of prefund.

When the manager contract is paused, account creation is stopped.

Developer Fee: This contracts also keeps the info about the developer wallet
and fee basis points. Which are used during the cheque cash in to pay for the
developer fee.

Service Registry: {TTMAccountManager} also acts as a registry for the services
that {TTMAccount} contracts add as a supported or wanted service. Registry
works by hashing (keccak256) the service name (string) and creating a mapping
as keccak256(serviceName) => serviceName. And provides functions that
{TTMAccount} function uses to register services. The {TTMAccount} only keeps
the hashes (byte32) of the registered services.

### PAUSER_ROLE

```solidity
bytes32 PAUSER_ROLE
```

Pauser role can pause the contract. Currently this only affects the
creation of TTM Accounts. When paused, account creation is stopped.

### UPGRADER_ROLE

```solidity
bytes32 UPGRADER_ROLE
```

Upgrader role can upgrade the contract to a new implementation.

### VERSIONER_ROLE

```solidity
bytes32 VERSIONER_ROLE
```

Versioner role can set new {TTMAccount} implementation address. When a
new implementation address is set, it is used for the new {TTMAccount}
creations.

The old {TTMAccount} contracts are not affected by this. Owners of those
should do the upgrade manually by calling the `upgradeToAndCall(address)`
function on the account.

### SERVICE_REGISTRY_ADMIN_ROLE

```solidity
bytes32 SERVICE_REGISTRY_ADMIN_ROLE
```

Service registry admin role can add and remove services to the service
registry mapping. Implemented by {ServiceRegistry} contract.

### TTMACCOUNT_ROLE

## ServiceRegistry

Service registry is used by the {TTMAccountManager} contract to register
services by hashing (keccak256) the service name (string) and creating a mapping
as keccak256(serviceName) => serviceName.

### ServiceRegistryStorage

```solidity
struct ServiceRegistryStorage {
  struct EnumerableSet.Bytes32Set _servicesHashSet;
  mapping(bytes32 => string) _serviceNameByHash;
  mapping(string => bytes32) _hashByServiceName;
}
```

### ServiceRegistered

```solidity
event ServiceRegistered(string serviceName, bytes32 serviceHash)
```

### ServiceUnregistered

```solidity
event ServiceUnregistered(string serviceName, bytes32 serviceHash)
```

### ServiceAlreadyRegistered

```solidity
error ServiceAlreadyRegistered(string serviceName)
```

### ServiceNotRegistered

```solidity
error ServiceNotRegistered()
```

### \_\_ServiceRegistry_init

```solidity
function __ServiceRegistry_init() internal
```

### \_\_ServiceRegistry_init_unchained

```solidity
function __ServiceRegistry_init_unchained() internal
```

### \_registerServiceName

```solidity
function _registerServiceName(string serviceName) internal virtual
```
